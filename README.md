cli tools installation for my UnRaid setup
- as the nerd tools app seems to have had no updates for 3+ months I'm deeming it (at last temporarily) abandoned
- this is my quick and dirty installer of stuff I have a need to use on a regualr(ish) basis

Fell free to fork it and hack it as you see fit.

Use at your own risk.
